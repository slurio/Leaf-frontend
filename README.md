# The Thread

Welcome to The Thread. A fashion app providing you the capability to scan your clothing labels to learn more about what you wear!

Consumers are more conscious about the products they buy, but it is difficult to shop for clothing consciously until now. The Thread does all the research for you by providing you the origin, fiber content, and care instructions for your clothing.
